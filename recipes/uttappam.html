            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Uthappam is a type of dosa from South India. In Tamil Nadu it is known as Uthappam (ஊத்தப்பம்), in Karnataka it is known as Uttappa (ಉತ್ತಪ್ಪ). In Kerala it is known as Oothappam (ഊത്തപ്പം) In Tulu it is known as Ootappa (ಊತಪ್ಪ) or Ootappo ( ಊತಪ್ಪೊ). Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, uttapam is thicker, with toppings. The name is derived from the Tamil words Appam and Utthia or Uttria, meaning Poured-Appam. Because Appam is cooked on a round bottom pan, whereas Utthia-Appam is cooked on a flat skillet. The Tamil ancient literature have a mention of it by its name. The classic breakfast of the Tamil residents consists of idli, dosai or uttappam mostly accompanied by sambar and chutney.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Onion 1/2 cup finely chopped</li>
                    <li>Idli batter 1/2 cup and a little more</li>
                    <li>Green chilli 1-2 minced</li>
                    <li>Ginger 1 inch piece minced</li>
                    <li>Oil for making uttappams (sesame seed oil preferable)</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl combine onion, green chilli and ginger. Sprinkle a little salt and mix it. Remember the dosa batter has salt in it already. Keep this ready before heating the dosa tawa</li>
                    <li>Heat a tawa, add a drop of oil and rub it with half an onion. This will help you to take the dosa from the tawa easily.</li>
                    <li>Once the tawa is heated well, reduce the heat to medium, pour a ladle of batter and spread it in a circular motion to form a thick dosa as shown in the picture. Do not spread it thin. Uthappams should be thick.</li>
                    <li>After a minute, sprinkle the onion mixture all over the dosa. Be generous in adding onions for the uthappam to taste great. Gently press it with the dosa ladle or spatula.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle a tsp of oil around the dosa. Once the the base is golden brown and you see lot of holes on the top, flip the dosa to the other side.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle a little oil on the other side also. Let it cook the other side. Once it is cooked, remove the dosa from the tawa and serve hot with chutney or sambar. </li>
                </ol>
